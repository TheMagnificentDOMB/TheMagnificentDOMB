"For the free we are raising a billion dollars with a B"

How can we raise a billion dollars with a "B," DOMB?

I AM ecstatic to hear you've asked!!

1) create a free account at TheMagnificentDOMB.com to get a free share of stock. You will then have one share of stock. :)
2) Want more shares of stock for free? Great. It's easy to get more free shares! You will get one additional share every time someone creates an account using your affiliate link to create a free account. Every time someone creates any kind of account using your link, they are then registered as one of your affiliates. They will get a share of stock, and you will get a share of stock.
3) What is really cool, is the shares keep coming in through the affiliate links created and distributed by the people who used your link. For 7 levels, you will continue to gain additional shares each time an affiliate creates an account using one of your affiliates' links. Or your cousin's sister's best friend's neighbor's coach's client's friend. They will get a share when they sign up, you will get a share, and so will everyone in between. For 7 levels. 

That sounds pretty cool, but really complicated, DOMB. What does something like that actually look like?

Well, If you were to create an account, for the free, you would have (1) share of stock, and that would have taken maybe 10 mins. 2 mins to receive the text, or see the post, and click the link, 4 mins to hear whats going on and 4 minutes to create a free account.

After creating youer account, you then happened to post the link to your Facebook and Instagram, and maybe a few of the text chats you have with people you think might be interested in some of the stuff we are doing. Let's say you spend 20 minutes sharing the link in texts and posts. By the time you finish posting, 10 people created accounts and you got one share each time they did, bringing your total up to 11 shares.

Let's say 10 people happened to pick up what we are laying down here and they all follow our #EbbandFlowsofLeadership, and create a free account.

You will then have 10 affiliates and 11 shares of stock.

After creating a free account, your affiliates simply shared the content they heard that directed them to the website, along with a few words about why they joined, to their Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and text/chat message groups. After 20 minutes of posting, they got the same results as you did! So when each of your 10 friends completed their 20 minutes of light work in affiliate link sharing; and their 10 friends each created an account, you got an additional 100 shares of stock! Did you share your link any more? Noooooooo. Did it cost you any more time thatn it took to get those first ten you got in the first 20 minutes of sharing the affiliate link you got, along with the content you heard or saw, and why you thought creating an account would make a difference? Not even a minute extra was spend after those ten people created accounts.

But you have 111 shares.

So, you created an account in 10 minutes, shared the content for 20 minutes, then forgot about the scheme until a friend called you 3 days later, and told you, "dude... I been signing people up like crazy the last three days... I signed up 100 people, I have 300MIL shares of stock. I was going to sign you up, but I saw you had posted this to your page already when I was going to message you. How many shares you got now??"

You log into your account and see that by encouraging 10 people to create an account like you did; after 3 days you now have 7 levels and 11,111,111 shares of stock in your account! For the free!

Wow. That is a lot of shares to own! How will owning all those free shares make me money, DOMB?

Great question.

When the network is established, meaning we have enough people who have created accounts to leverage our resources comfortably, we will begin doing funding rounds to raise capital to purchase cash flowing assets. Each transaction will generate a commission for account holders of TheMagnificentDOMB.com. Commissions are paid on the first $20 of every transaction. So say we do a round of funding and 8 million, $1 transactions are made in your network of affiliates; you would earn 1-5 pennies from each transaction. That would be a commission of over $80,000.
